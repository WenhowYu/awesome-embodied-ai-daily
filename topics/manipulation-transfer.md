## METTA: Memory-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation for Meta-Reinforcement Learning

- [arXiv 2610.31656](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.31656) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31656)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31656)

METTA separates fast gradient-updated within-episode neural memory from compact cross-episode summaries. It reports over 50% success on held-out Meta-World ML10/45 task families and better long-context sparse-reward exploration.

## Echo: Coupled Action and Task Status Signal Denoising for Vision Language Action Models

- [arXiv 2610.31569](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.31569) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31569)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31569)

Echo jointly denoises actions plus stop/failure signals. Structured attention and faster signal denoising let cleaner status estimates guide action generation. Success, failure and recovery trajectories supply supervision without frame-level progress labels. Real-world scores are not success rates. Action supervision and training budgets are matched, but Echo receives extra failure-status data. Cross-method comparisons focus on flower insertion with adapted protocols; two tasks have no failed evaluation episodes. Benefits from higher-level stopping or replanning integration remain untested. The three-second outcome-window F1 does not imply instantaneous failure detection; simulation status accuracy covers ongoing/success frames under a specified window, not general three-class failure detection.

## FocusVLA: Future-Intent Guided Dynamic View Routing for Vision-Language-Action Models

- [arXiv 2610.31423](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.31423) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31423)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31423)

Predicts future interaction intent from multimodal observations, state and action history to route global and wrist views in π0.5, using trajectory-derived weak labels. The real-robot gain is 13.3 percentage points. Cross-embodiment and diverse camera configurations remain untested; the added module requires training.

## PiHand: Latent Hand-Object Interaction Priors for Physics-Based Policy Learning

- [arXiv 2610.31299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.31299) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31299)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31299)

PiHand distills simulated mocap-tracking experts into a goal-conditioned hand–object latent prior, then learns bounded residual exploration in that latent space. The same interaction prior supports new objects, trajectories, catching and bimanual handovers.

## Memory before Goal: Role of Pre-History Memory for Humanoid Loco-Manipulation

- [arXiv 2610.31166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.31166) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31166)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.31166)

WholeBodyMem selects historical frames from SAM3 object events and supplies object spatiotemporal tokens and memory attention to a whole-body action expert. This is within-episode perceptual history, not cross-episode skill accumulation. Physical tests have only ten trials per task and no uniform-memory real-robot comparator. Missed SAM3 detections and tracking overhead remain limitations.

## UniFlowWAM: A Unified World-Action Model with Visual Semantics and 4D Geometry

- [arXiv 2610.30991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30991) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30991)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30991)

Three experts jointly model future vision, 3D scene flow and actions under ten objectives; deployment requires no flow input. 58.9% is the best evaluation seed; 87.7% uses the best evaluated checkpoint. Real policies are task-specific and starts remain within demonstration coverage; flow pseudo-labels are noisy.

## In-Context Learning World Models for Robot Dual-Arm Manipulation of Soft Garment with Partial Observations

- [arXiv 2610.30988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30988) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30988)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30988)

Generative point-cloud completion feeds context-conditioned Transformer dynamics that rank flow-matching action proposals, without test-time weight updates. No real-robot policy comparator; success uses point-cloud-distance thresholds. PCN has better CD/EMD, whereas this method favors correspondence MSE. Dynamic motions and closed-loop replanning remain untested.

## TEAR: Task-Evidence Authority Routing for Robotic Manipulation

- [arXiv 2610.30819](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30819) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30819)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30819)

TEAR combines network measurements, CLIP task cues and recent robot state in a causal temporal router that allocates authority between human teleoperation and local VLA control. Real trials were supervised: four manual switches occurred across two episodes. Evidence covers two related tasks and synthetic network impairment, with separately trained routers. Offline handoff F1 is 0.308 but recall only 0.286, below the rule baseline's 0.429. No official code link was located.

## Adaptive Aerial Loco-Manipulation Policy Learning via LLM-Assisted Proactive Task Generation

- [arXiv 2610.30810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30810) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30810)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30810)

ALMA trains historical context with action-conditioned future-response prediction and uses LLM-generated arm-motion structures to expand RL training tasks based on failures. Deployment weights are fixed; adaptation is contextual, not test-time gradient training. Physical comparison is only against PID, so the 79.6% reduction is not relative to the strongest simulation baseline. Contact-force control remains future work.

## DeXplicit: Making Physical State Explicit in Dexterous Manipulation World Models

- [arXiv 2610.30781](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30781) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30781)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30781)

DeXplicit predicts object-centric motion and deformation in metric 3D before rendering action-conditioned video. Matched-input comparisons reduce long-horizon moved-point error 27–40% versus adapted PointWorld; explicit geometry improves object fidelity.

## SmolVLA-MoE: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Efficient Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation

- [arXiv 2610.30732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30732) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30732)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30732)

SmolVLA-MoE adds token-routed sparse FFN experts and a shared expert to the action module while freezing the VLM. It reports 84.25% mean LIBERO success versus 82.75% for dense SmolVLA, with about 500M activated and 800M stored parameters.

## Co^2Gen: Collaboratively Generating Task Plans for Decentralized Multi-Robot and Human Collaboration

- [arXiv 2610.30671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30671) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30671)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30671)

Generates conditional collaborative programs with multi-agent planning, then converts executions into data for decentralized SmolVLA training. The strongest result depends on mixed human single-arm data, so the entire pipeline is not human-free. Generated data alone retains execution bottlenecks. Two tasks and limited trials do not establish general cross-embodiment transfer.

## Self-Distilling Future Video Representations for World Action Models

- [arXiv 2610.30320](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30320) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30320)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.30320)

Observation history and EMA self-distillation improve future representations from one video-denoising pass for an action decoder. Appendices allow partial credit, so scores are not uniformly binary full-task success. Transfer instruction following is zero without human videos; cross-embodiment correspondence is implicit.

## The Bitter Lesson Comes to Robotics

- [arXiv 2610.25287](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.25287) · v2 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.25287)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v2, revised)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2610.25287)

The Bitter Lesson Comes to Robotics compares frontier language models directly controlling physical YAM arms under a 40-action budget. The revision expands seven models/twelve settings to nine models/fifteen settings and updates the historical performance fit.

## HEX: Humanoid-Aligned Experts for Cross-Embodiment Whole-Body Manipulation

- [arXiv 2604.07993](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.07993) · v3 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2604.07993)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v3, revised)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2604.07993)

HEX combines canonical body-part states, a mixture-of-experts proprioceptive predictor, compact visual history and flow-matching actions for humanoid whole-body manipulation. This revision adds two household long-horizon tasks, a ψ0 comparison, OOD pretraining tests and data-scaling/sensitivity experiments.

## Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models

- [arXiv 2602.12628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12628) · v5 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2602.12628)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-23 (v5, revised)](../daily/2026-10-23.md#arxiv-2602.12628)

RL-Co combines sim/real supervised warm-starting with simulator RL anchored by real-data supervision. The new revision adds a stronger rollout-distillation control and makes the limited real-world statistical protocol explicit.

## CW-WAM: A Structured Contact-Wrench World Action Model for Force-Sensitive Manipulation

- [arXiv 2610.30117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30117) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.30117)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.30117)

Contact-wrench history improves force-sensitive manipulation under matched ablations, but hand-set gains and larger contact forces prevent a general safety claim.

## Asymmetric On-Policy Distillation Learns In-Context Exploration

- [arXiv 2610.30105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30105) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.30105)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.30105)

Privileged on-policy distillation learns exploration across episodes sharing hidden conditions; real-robot samples are limited and context is not a permanent skill library.

## From Reasoning to Action: Benchmarking Frontier AI Models on LIBERO-10 Robot Manipulation Tasks

- [arXiv 2610.30051](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30051) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.30051)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.30051)

A tool-based LIBERO-10 benchmark measures frontier models without manipulation pretraining; a 44/100 versus 43/100 result is too close for a robust ranking.

## CausGround: Causal Interaction Grounding for Adaptive Embodied Planning

- [arXiv 2610.29702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.29702) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29702)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29702)

An offline causal knowledge base improves planning, but RoboCasa uses replay-based high-level evaluation and the knowledge base does not grow during deployment.

## Relational Geometry Forcing for World Action Models

- [arXiv 2610.29282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.29282) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29282)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29282)

Training-only relational geometry supervision improves WAM generalization, although LIBERO gains are small and the temporal term alone is harmful.

## DepState-JEPA: Learning Depth-Grounded State Representation for Visual Perception and Manipulation

- [arXiv 2610.29246](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.29246) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29246)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29246)

Depth-grounded predictive representations transfer to matched real scenes, but fixed calibration, embodiment-specific training, and excluded search time limit transfer and speed claims.

## Learning to Absorb Corrections: Critic-Weighted Residual Flow for Vision-Based Insertion

- [arXiv 2610.29117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.29117) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29117)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.29117)

Critic-weighted residual learning is absorbed into ACT: residual-off success improves from 16% to 76%; cross-task forgetting and VLA transfer remain untested.

## COWBOY: A Scalable Sim-to-Real Framework for Learning Contextual Whole-Body Manipulation

- [arXiv 2610.28948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.28948) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.28948)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.28948)

Local grasping experts support contextual whole-body manipulation, with strong real-robot results; compute is unmatched and the system does not learn continually in deployment.

## Real2Sem2Real: 3D Semantic Augmentations for Robot Learning from a Single Human RGB Demonstration

- [arXiv 2610.28880](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.28880) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.28880)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.28880)

Semantic 3D augmentation turns one human video into robot data with strong controlled gains, but teleoperation comparisons are unmatched and setup remains manual.

## T-WLA: Bridging Slow Vision and Fast Touch

- [arXiv 2610.28814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.28814) · v1 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.28814)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v1, new)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2610.28814)

A fast tactile editor corrects pending actions, but the no-touch variant nearly matches full performance, limiting how much gain can be attributed to touch.

## ASPIRE: Agentic /Skills Discovery for Robotics

- [arXiv 2607.00272](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.00272) · v2 · [Latest entry](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2607.00272)
- Coverage history: [2026-10-22 (v2, revised)](../daily/2026-10-22.md#arxiv-2607.00272)

The revision adds real-robot cross-episode textual skill accumulation; per-rotation time improves, but total cube-solving time is not monotonic and human support remains.
